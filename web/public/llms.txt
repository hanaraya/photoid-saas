# SafePassportPic - AI-Friendly Summary

> Create compliant passport and visa photos in 60 seconds. 100% private — all processing happens in your browser.

## What is SafePassportPic?

SafePassportPic is a web application that creates government-compliant passport and visa photos instantly. Unlike traditional services, all photo processing happens entirely in the user's browser using on-device AI — photos are never uploaded to any server.

## Key Features

- **100% Private**: Photos never leave your device. All AI processing runs locally in browser.
- **60-Second Process**: Snap a selfie → AI removes background → download print-ready result.
- **20+ Country Standards**: US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, India, China, Schengen, and more.
- **AI-Powered**: Automatic face detection, background removal, and compliance checking.
- **Real-Time Camera Guides**: On-screen positioning overlay shows exactly where to place your face while taking a photo.
- **Visual Compliance Overlay**: See head size, eye position, and margins measured against official requirements in real-time.
- **Smart Retake Suggestions**: If your photo doesn't meet requirements, get specific guidance on what to fix (lighting, angle, expression, etc.).
- **One-Time Price**: $4.99 for unlimited photos in a session (no subscription).
- **Mobile-First**: Works on any phone or computer with a modern browser.
